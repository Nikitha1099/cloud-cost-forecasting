# ☁️ Cloud Cost Prediction using Machine Learning

A powerful and lightweight machine learning model that predicts **cloud infrastructure cost** based on key resource inputs: CPU, memory, and storage. This helps teams estimate spend **before** provisioning resources — enabling **better cost control and planning**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Cloud services offer unmatched scalability and flexibility — but without cost control, they can become **financially inefficient**. Organizations often struggle to anticipate the future costs of their workloads, leading to unexpected billing surprises.

This project builds an end-to-end ML pipeline that:

- Ingests structured infrastructure usage data
- Trains a regression model to predict cloud cost
- Serves the model via a REST API using FastAPI
- Provides real-time cost estimates

It helps developers, architects, and cloud teams make **data-driven financial decisions** on their resource provisioning.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure provide billing dashboards and cost estimators, but:

- They are **reactive**: You see costs after consumption
- They are **manual**: No API to forecast based on custom input
- They lack **custom ML logic** that reflects internal pricing models

This project solves that by allowing users to **predict cloud costs dynamically**, based on CPU, memory, and storage values — all in an extensible, API-driven manner.

---

## 🔍 Solution Approach

We model the problem as a **regression task**, where:

- **Inputs:** Number of vCPUs, RAM (in GB), and Storage (in GB)
- **Target:** Monthly cost (USD)

##  Real-World Impact

###  Why Predict Cloud Costs?

Predicting cloud costs before provisioning infrastructure is like knowing your electricity bill before turning on the appliances.

Cloud pricing is complex — driven by:
-  vCPUs
-  RAM (GB)
-  Storage (GB)

With this model:
-  Avoid surprise cloud bills
-  Simulate infra costs for upcoming deployments
-  Align with your budgeting strategy

### 👤 Example Use Case 1: DevOps/Developer Team

> “I need a VM with 8 CPUs, 32 GB RAM, 500 GB storage. What’s the monthly cost?”

Rather than guess, call the API → get estimate → decide → save costs 💰

### 👤 Use Case 2: Product / Finance Team

> “We expect 20,000 new users next month. Can we model cost for scaled infra?”

This tool allows the team to simulate and compare different resource combinations **before provisioning** anything.

---
### Steps:

1. **Prepare a synthetic dataset** of cloud resource combinations and corresponding costs
2. **Train a regression model** using scikit-learn
3. **Serialize the model** using Pickle
4. **Serve predictions** via a FastAPI app at a `/predict` endpoint
5. **Accept JSON input** and return real-time cost estimate

The current model uses a basic `LinearRegression`, but it can be easily extended to other ML or even XGBoost models as needed.
